# Ways of running Python code

One line at a time

* In IDLE interactively
* At `python3` prompt on CSIL

A file at a time

* Through Run menu in IDLE
* `python3 file.py`
* `python3 -i file.py`

# Using import for your own functions

# if __name__=="__main__":


# Some Unix Commands

Directory means "folder"

* `cd`  change directory
* `pwd`  print working directory (tell me what directory I'm in right now)
* `ls`   list files
